# Week 1 report


   ## What have you done this week?

   I chose subject of my program and wrote the project spesification. 
    
 ## How has the project progressed?

 I planned what kind of program I'm going to do and wrote a project spesification document about it.

## What did you learn this week / today?

This week I learned about the stable marriage problem and what kind of stuff should be considered when designing an algorithm.

##  What has been inclear or problematic? 

I found only one algorithm to use in my project. I will probably apply the Gale-Shapley algorhitm some way as described in (Stable marriage with indifference Wikipedia article)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_with_indifference] or something. I'm not quite sure how to expand my use of algorhitms in the project or where to look for good algorithms.
   
## What next?

Should start the project.

## Hours used

In this week I have worked total 3 hours with this project.
