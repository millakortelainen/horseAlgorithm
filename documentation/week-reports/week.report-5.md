# Week 5 report
## What have you done this week?

I have done the peroformance tests for the Gale-Shapely algorithm and continued writing the documentation of the project.

## How has the project progressed?

The project itself didin't really progressed this week and I'm quite unhappy about it. Although the tests and documentation are now in pretty good shape in my opinion. 

## What did you learn this week / today?

Performance testing was new to me so that gave me a good change to learn. 

## What has been inclear or problematic?

Everything is going well application wise.

## What next?

I'd like to make the analysis of the performance tests using linear regression to compare the performance to the expected performance which is n^2. I'd like to make a brute force algorithm for calculating the optimal pairs of the horses and riders and compare that approach to Gale Shapley algorithm. 

## Hours used

Past week I have worked total 8 hours with this project.
