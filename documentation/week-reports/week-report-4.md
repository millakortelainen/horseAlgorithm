# Week 4 report


## What have you done this week?
In past week I got the Gale-Shapley algorithm ready and wrote quite a few unit tests.

 ## How has the project progressed?
 I thinkt that project progressed very well in this week. The project's core functionalities are now ready so in the future I can focus on expanding the project and doing performance testing.

## What did you learn this week / today?

This week I keep learning about the same thing that I started learning last week. This means that I continued to learn about how to implement an algorthm from pseudo code. I'm wondering how my own version of the algorithm ended up so much different than the pseudo code algorithm.

##  What has been inclear or problematic? 
Everything is going well.

## What next?
Next I'm going to write performance tests.

## Hours used
Past week I have worked total 5 hours with this project.
