# Week 4 report


## What have you done this week?
In past week I got the Gale-Shapley algorithm ready and wrote quite a few unit tests.

 ## How has the project progressed?
 I thinkt that project progressed very well in this week. The project's core functionalities are now ready so in the future I can focus on expanding the project and doing performance testing. One of this week's submission requirements was that performance testing has begun. This is where I'm falling behind little bit but I'm able to start performance testing next week so I'm not falling behind that bad.

## What did you learn this week / today?

This week I keep learning about the same thing that I started learning last week. This means that I continued to learn about how to implement an algorthm from pseudo code. I'm wondering how my own version of the algorithm ended up so much different than the pseudo code algorithm.

##  What has been inclear or problematic? 
Everything is going well.

## What next?
Next I'm going to write performance tests. I should also consider what data structures I want to implement myself. Although I haven't begun the performance testing, I did study [it from the exmaple project](https://github.com/TiraLabra/Testing-and-rmq/tree/master/src/main/java/rmq/util). Performance testing Is totally new to me. I believe that next week will be very instructive for me. I probably should also schedule couple extra hours for working on the project because the nature of the testing is new to me.

## Hours used
Past week I have worked total 14 hours with this project.
