# Week 2 report


  ## What have you done this week?

 This week I started coding. Setting up gradle project took most of my time. The horse algorithm is now in walking skeleton phase.
    
 ## How has the project progressed?

Project has progressed well. It even has some functionalities now. I did the core ability to match the horses and riders and calculate a score for those pairs. Now the score calculator is quite naive but it gives a value for a pair. Also I wrote some JUnit tests and Javadoc documentation so the testing and the documentation aspect progressed as well. Simple command line user interface was made for the program.

## What did you learn this week / today?

This week I learned about setting up a gradle application. This included a learning experience about how important it is to update build.grade-file. I mean for a while I thought that I can't do a simple Scanner reader for my program but then I realised that my build.gradle-file didn't have all the needed code. 

I learned to make a generic data structure for pairs. I needed this kind of data structure for my horses and riders. This is where I found little bit contradictory information from the internet. Stack exchange told me that there isn't such data structure in Java but in Java documentation I found a documentation of pairs. Anyway I decided to create the data structure by myself.

##  What has been inclear or problematic? 
Mostly I'm wondering if the project is going to the right way but otherwise no major questions arised in past week.

## What next?
I will create the experience variable for the rider. Experience variable effects the next pairing score of the horse and rider. Expanding weights of the pairing calculation is also in the todo list. I'd like to start writing code for the Gale Shapley algorithm next week.

## Hours used

Past week I have worked total 16 hours with this project.
