# Week 5 report
## What have you done this week?

I have done the peroformance tests for the Gale-Shapely algorithm and continued writing the documentation of the project. Due the last weeks's feed back I removed the Java .stream() code from my algorithm which did the sorting of the lists and replaced it with compareble-interface.

## How has the project progressed?

No new functionalities were added to the application this week. The progress happened mostly in testing and documentation. Those are now in pretty good shape in my opinion. I reached my last week's goals in terms of performance testing and core of my program is ready. I think my data structures are mostly done.

## What did you learn this week / today?

Performance testing was new to me so that gave me a good change to learn. 

## What has been inclear or problematic?

Everything is going well application wise. I use ArrayList quite a lot in my project. Should I implement it by myself?

## What next?

I am going to make the analysis of the performance tests using linear regression to compare the performance to the expected performance which is n^2. I'd like to make a brute force algorithm for calculating the optimal pairs of the horses and riders and compare that approach to Gale Shapley algorithm. I could also try to optimize the Gale-Shapley algorithm and analyse how that affects to performance. Now the algorithm's code includes sorting and stuff like that which could be done elsewhere.

## Hours used

Past week I have worked total 8 hours with this project.
